# PRINCE2 (PRojects IN Controlled Environments)
is a structured project management method.
PRINCE2 emphasises dividing projects into manageable and controllable
stages.

  7 Themes
  7 Principles

The principles are the foundations upon which everything else in the
methodology is based.

  1. Continued business justification
     Benefits tolerance - he mandate should identify the threshold of
     profit that determines the viability of the business case.
     Update stage-by-stage - broken down into stages, for ease of
     manageability.
     Checking ongoing viability - by each stage.
     Premature closure
     Benefits are not always financial

  2. Learn from experience
     Remain alert to lessons
     Project manager’s responsibility - identify, document and
     disseminate lessons.
     Lessons log - lessons learned from previous projects.
     Auditing - proof that steps have been taken to avoid repeating
     previous mistakes.
     Hiring based upon lessons
     Lessons repository

  3. Defined roles and responsibilities
     A lack of clear leadership is a common cause of project failure.
     Levels of management - three levels.
     Project board
     Stakeholders - three stakeholder interests: business, user and
     supplier.

  4. Manage by stages
     Each stage of a project must be properly planned, monitored, and
     controlled.
     Minimum of two stages.
     Initiation stage
     Project initiation documentation (PID)
     Planning horizon
     Go/no go
     Stages are a control for the project board

  5. Manage by exception
     Tolerances are established for each project objective (time,
     cost, quality, scope, benefits and risk).
     Highlight reports - regular highlight reports keep the project
     board informed about progress.
     Only if a tolerance level is forecast to be exceeded (known as an
     ‘exception’ in PRINCE2), does the project board address the issue
     through the assessment of an exception report.
     Project tolerances
     Stage tolerances
     Work package tolerances
     Benefits of "managing by exception" - he project board ‘manages
     by exception’ i.e. only gets involved when key decisions need to
     be taken.

  6. Focus on products
     Product-based planning - Product-based planning is a crucial
     aspect of the PRINCE2 approach to managing projects.
     Product descriptions - The agreed products define the project’s
     scope, as well as providing a foundation for planning and control
     activities.

  7. Tailor to suit the project
     Tailoring whilst remaining compliant
     Even on a small project, you will need to address risk, quality
     and change control. If the method is changed too much, you will
     be in danger of running a ‘PINO’ (that’s ‘PRINCE2 In Name Only’)
     project.
     Tailoring goals

The simple test whether the project is applying all 7 of the PRINCE2
principles and whether the project is applying the minimum
requirements of the 7 themes proves that the project is managed by the
PRINCE2 methodology.

Prince 2 Themes:

There are 7 PRINCE 2 Themes:

  1. Business Case
     The purpose of this theme is to put in place mechanisms which
     assists the senior decision makers to decide whether the project
     is (and remains) a worthwhile investment. It is the theme which
     primarily implements the ‘continued business justification’
     principle.
     - Customer-supplier environment
     - Executive
     - Outline business case
     - Outputs, outcomes and benefits
     - Senior user
     - Benefits management approach
     - Minimum requirements
  2. Organization
     The purpose of this theme is to define and set up a project
     management team structure which defines who is accountable and
     responsible on the project.
     - Customer organization
     - Supplier organization
     - Project board role
       - executive (from customer)
       - senior user (from customer)
       - senior supplier (from supplier organization)
     - Project assurance role
     - Project manager role
     - Team manager role
     - Change authority role
     - Project support role
     Sharing roles, Combining roles
     Stakeholders: All of the above roles form the project management
       team and they are all stakeholders on the project.
     Communication management approach - written down

     Minimum requirements:
     You must define your project's organization structure and roles
     (by ensuring all responsibilities in PRINCE2’s role descriptions
     are fulfilled). You must define your project's approach to
     communicating and engaging with stakeholders and you must produce
     and maintain the project initiation documentation (PID), and a
     communication management approach.
