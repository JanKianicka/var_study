[6/23 8:47 AM] PHILIPP Anne
    ok, so you'd like to have a real taught course 
[6/23 8:48 AM] PHILIPP Anne
    I would like that too
[6/23 8:48 AM] PHILIPP Anne
    are you interested in a specific programming language?
[6/23 8:49 AM] PHILIPP Anne
    MPI or OpenMP or GPU?
[6/23 8:50 AM] PHILIPP Anne
     I know about these two options:

    i do not know if somethig like that exists

I am afraid that all, e.g. three days courses, will be ready for
various audiences and thus to be on the safe side start with some
elementary things like: what is a string, what is a number and in the
afternoon the last day it could be finally interesting

well, this has 4 hours of videos and covers what KIANICKA Jan asked
Optimize performance and efficiency by leveraging NumPy, SciPy, and
Cython for numerical computations.

# Records of the course
We use python3 (I used to work just with python2.6, python2.7)

Why is python slow:
1. Interpreted language with
2. Dynamic typing
3. Flexible data structures
4. Multithreading -
   Unfortunately, the memory management of the standard CPython
   interpreter is not thread-safe, and it uses something called Global
   Interpreter Lock (GIL) to safeguard memory integrity.

Fortunately, as we discuss in the course, many of the bottlenecks can
be circumvented.

As stated by famous computer scientist Donald Knuth already in the 70â€™s:
   Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or
   worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs,
   and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative
   impact when debugging and maintenance are considered: premature
   optimization is the root of all evil.

90% of time is spent in 10% of the source code.

Thus, it is clear that when optimizing one should focus only in the
time-critical parts of the program. How to find these hotspots is the
task of performance analysis.
- applications own timers
- performance analysis software

Some software by end of the execution provides own timers informaiton.
Bonus: timing with a context manager

Measuring very short execution times has some pitfalls that can be
avoided with the help of the 'timeit' Python module.

> python3 -m timeit -s "from math import sin" "sin(0.2)"
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0523 usec per loop

Inside interpreter:
>>> import timeit
>>> timeit.timeit('"-".join(str(n) for n in range(100))', number=10000)

Using of profiler cProfile:
> python3 -m cProfile -o profile.dat mandel_main.py
> python3 -m pstats profile.dat
# stripping of full path
profile.dat% strip
# sorting by time consumed
profile.dat% sort time
# show the 10m slowest functions
profile.dat% stats 10


For heat_main profiling we have this result:

We hope that you remember the number one rule in performance optimization:
Measure before you optimize!
