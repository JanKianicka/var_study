Seismograms of various formats (e.g. SAC, MiniSEED, GSE2, SEISAN, Q, etc.) can be imported into a Stream object using the read() function.
Streams are list-like objects which contain multiple Trace objects, i.e. gap-less continuous time series and related header/meta information.
Each Trace object has a attribute called data pointing to a NumPy ndarray of the actual time series and the attribute stats which contains all meta information in a dictionary-like Stats object. Both attributes starttime and endtime of the Stats object are UTCDateTime objects.
The following example demonstrates how a single GSE2-formatted seismogram file is read into a ObsPy Stream object. There exists only one Trace in the given seismogram:
