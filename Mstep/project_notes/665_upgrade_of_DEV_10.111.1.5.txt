# Along with development of CurrentDataReaderAgent we upgrade and test it for Azet
# 26.11.2021 - DEV, Backup OPS 10.111.1.5

1. Copied over newer tomcat from 10.111.5.171 and changed the link
> pushd /opt
> rm tomcat
> ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.16 tomcat

2. Copied over upgrade.sh from Belgrade

3. Addressed CLDB cleaning issues collected with Mata

4. Executed upgrade - IMS4 is running afterwards, but
there are a lot of errors in the CLDB intialization.

cfg/envidb/DBCreateCfg_qc.xml
PostgreSQL non compatible functions.
We got rid of them on our Belgrade machine,
however, here they are in spite of having the same configuration.

We need to upgrade also PostgrSQL data server locally.
Better coordinate with Integrators - create sub-task for that - for november.
Now I just start the IMS4 as it was.

# 27.10.2021 - After successful night build I will upgrade at least CurrentDataReaderAgent.
- night build failed this day - have to run once more the limited build.

After deployment of the CurrentDataReaderAgent new verison, conduct:
1. Functional test with verbose logging - level 5.

2. Performance test with logging level 3 - with this we can start, there is always about 60 000 S/M messages in
   the CurrentDataCsv folder.

   After deployment, the performance test:

   Performant enough - but portion of availble data for the stations is very poor.
   Adjusted expiration time to 120 minutes for each, S and M as well.
   Maximum number was ~630 values of ~1000 stations configured.
