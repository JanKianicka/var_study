Lifted index:
-------------
The lifted index (LI) is calculated as the difference between the
observed temperature at 500 hPa and the temperature of an air parcel
lifted to 500 hPa from near the surface. The more unstable the
environment, the more negative the LI.

LI values have been empirically linked to convective events as follows:
LI Value 	Severe Weather Potential

-2 	        Weak
-3 to -5 	Moderate
-6 or less 	Strong

These threshold values are valid for the eastern 2/3 of the United
States. The values must be modified upward (i.e. less negative) for
higher elevations in the West. As with CAPE, you should never rely
solely on LI to evaluate the convective potential.



Boyden index:
------------
A measure of the mean thermodynamic stability in a layer beneath 700
mb.

The Boyden index is given by I-Z-T-200, where I is the Boyden index, Z
is the 1000–700- mb thickness in dam, and T is the 700-mb temperature
in °C.
