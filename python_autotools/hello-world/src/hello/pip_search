=======

Evaluate simple Python mathmatical and logical expressions

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu

An attempt to make a safe evaluator of a subset of Python expressions.

This is mostly a proof-of-concept for getting feedback, it has not been
thoroughly checked for safety, use at your own risk :)

It uses the Python ast module to parse the expression, but all evaluation is
done by walking the ast, it is not directly executed by the Python runtime.

Nosetests are provided below including coverage of supported and unsupported
operations.

Known security considerations:

The variables are expected to be simple primitive types. Providing functions
with unsafe effects, or variables where the operator implementations can have
unsafe effects is obviously unsafe.

Some operations may also take a lot of time or memory and DOS the process. 

Usage::

  import quipu
  result = quipu.evaluate('2 + 2')


See the list of "supported_expressions" in ``test_asteval.py`` for an example of
what operations are implemented.

suds_requests             - suds_requests
=============

suds_requests is a suds transport implemented with requests. This lets you use
all of the goodness of requests (connection pooling, simple auth, etc.) along
with the pain of soap.


Examples
=======

Simple::

    import suds.client
    import suds_requests

    c = suds.client.Client(
        'http://wsdl_url',
        transport=suds_requests.RequestsTransport()
    )


Adding basic auth::

    import requests
    import suds.client
    import suds_requests

    session = requests.Session(auth=('user', 'password'))

    c = suds.client.Client(
        'http://wsdl_url',
        transport=suds_requests.RequestsTransport(session)
    )

Changing the connection pool size::

    import requests
