Nice, but not in all repositories the new approach is followed 
and creating/removing merged feature branch could be simplified by
using pipeline which does not allow merge when chosen Jenkins tests fail.
Detail remarks are recorder in my second notes file:

Reading document: Description of the Cdtools Continuous Delivery Prototype as Implemented

Overlay file system - funionfs was chosen:
FunionFS means an Union filesystem for the FUSE driver.
This program works only with the Fuse driver which is natively included since the 2.6.14 Linux kernel.
Above all, what is an Union filesystem?
It is a method used when one wants to manufacture LiveCD Linux such as Knoppix: support (CDROM) is only a read-only one.
The operating system, however, needs to write on this filesystem.
The method consists in superimposing (Union) on the read only filesystem, a small size read-write one.
This filesystem (often stored in a RAMDISK) contains all the modifications made by OS on the CDROM content.
This method is often used for of Linux Stored in a PROM or a compressed file like in CRAMFS.

In our case was chosen for overalay of configuration tree.

devlab01:
There are users auto/cmss which simulates real operational enviroment.
There is QUANDEF instance of the database.
Important users:
/home/misc/
  auto
  cats
  cmss

/home/misc/auto/
  cleanUpDB
  compareReports.pl
  crontab
  keep_cds_alive
  run_cdqual
  start_cdtool
/home/misc/auto/.odbc.ini
  [operations]
  Description             = CDTools snap
  Driver                  = oracle
  ServerName              = dba1119.qandef

/home/misc/cmss/
  deployCdtools.sh
  rollbackCdtools.sh

/home/misc/cats/ - is empty, basically only .ssh is there


Qestions:
Reading document Description of the Cdtools COD:
COD_Q1: There is mentioned cleaning crontab running on staging area or accpetance testing area
on devlab* machines. System should be deployed to devlab01, or devlab03. Cleaning crontab should be owned by the user 'auto' but for cleaning DB is used
/home/consult/klinkl/cleanUpDB
I have not found this script on any of the devlab machines.
Where it resides and where I can have a look on it?


Something here.
