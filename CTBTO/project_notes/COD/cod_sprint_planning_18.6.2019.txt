# Sprint planning with Thomas for incorporation of VDMS system into CATS and COD project

Thomas proposals:
---
COD-170 Align and Tailor (if necessary) COD process with Responsible for VDMS
 (probably make some agreement with Manachem and Edward Wokabi)
COD-171 Handling of Configuration Changes in VDMS COD
 (as far as we know configuration changes are really part of the github repository - thus changed with the code
  what is a very unfortunate and dangerous pattern - proved as bad in mixing of DFX scheme files with app_config before)

COD-175 Organization and Content of Nxus Artifacts for VDMS
  COD-176 Define List of Files that are Part of VDMS release
  COD-177 NEXUS directory structure
  (can be retrieved from installation package directory)

COD-178 Define Target Machines for Test and Deployment of VDMS
  COD-179 Define, Request and Prepare Target Machine for VDMS Maintainer's Staging Area
  COD-180 Define, Request and Prepare Target Machine for VDMS Acceptance Test Staging Area
  COD-181 Define, Request and Prepare Target Machine for Unit Tests
  COD-182 Define, Request and Prepare Target Machine for Integration/Blackbox Testing
  (this is part of the CATS infrastructure extension)

COD-172 Prototype Automatic Build of VDMS
  COD-173 Create Jenkins Job
  COD-174 Creation of Release Artifacts and Upload to Nexus

COD-183 Define Test Set and Prerequisites for Automated Tests of VDMS
  COD-184 Define List of Unit Tests
  COD-185 Define VDMS Components to Start for Unit and Integration Tests
  COD-186 Define Database Tables abd Content needed for Automated Tests
  COD-187 Define Database to be used depending on Test Type

COD-188 Prototype Automatic Deployment of VDMS and Configuration Changes
  COD-189 Deployment to Maintainer Staging Area
  COD-190 Deployment to Acceptance Test Staging Area

COD-191 Prototype Automatic DCR creation for VDMS testing (Workaround until Jira Process in implemented)
  COD-192 Document VDMS COD Prototype as Implemented


Bridge to my current work what is achievable and having user stories which is possible to estimate.

Stories:
Meet with Manachem on QA list from documentation - record answers
Meet with Manachem and attempt to launch VDMS system on dlv018 - second instance
  record procedure, end points, Oracle schemas  - learing curve also for Peter Polzer in order to support us

Meet with Edward Wokabi - clarify support
 - we need suport in order to harmonize build and installation procedures, implement CATS build scripts
   in the VDMS repositories
 - we potentially need support from him or Cyrille for:
    - consulting - clarification of questions
    - fixing of unit tests which as observed were left over not running and not maintained.

Launch command line interface for several representative messages on devlan
  - request personal and technical user which might be used to run bbox test - for VDMS Devlan appache server

Towards VDMS COD - autmated integration testing -
  - Create detail architecture desing of CATS VDMS environment - for unit and bbox testing
    What is needed in CATS and what will be external dependencies
