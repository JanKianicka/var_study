Here the records of preparations.

ISI-748 Adaption of msg client (XMLRPC) to be used without SSO
---
For a discussion:
For NDC/Users who use ONLY GCI links for obtaining data SSO could be replaced by following:
 - whitelist IPs per a destination (as we do for CD stations/opening firewall)
 - use certificate/token

For implementation msg client&XMLRPC shall be updated (not straight forward).

User Requirements Inspection Meeting Minutes - 22 April 2016 - not important document -
just formal inspection of the requeirement collection process.


Technical discussion and retrieval of technical information
from Cyrille:
------------

1. VDMS
SEISAN integration:
-----------
[te_format_shi_bulletin]
template_dir=%(ENV[NMS_HOME])/etc/templates
storage_dir=%(ENV[NMS_DATA])
nordic_executable=%(ENV[NMS_THIRD_PARTY])/bin/norims

All third party executables in production are supposed to be in that directory.
So, do you want me to change the test file to use SEISAN_HOME?

Nordinc format documented here:
https://www.geosig.com/files//GS_SEISAN_9_0_1.pdf
Appendix A

- Give me list of features eventually with Jira links where are I can find details which were implemented and were never released to OPS – also specification
* NORDIC products
* DLSEED products 
* removal of regional screening
* new Category criteria for some radionuclide products (ARR, RRR, ARR_html, RRR_html, SPHD, SPHF) 
* SSREB_html product
 
From what I can see, here is what is already in operations:
* NEB/NSEB products (which use evsc_drv executable)
* new EXECSUM products

Can you tell me, from the latest DCR avaiable, what version is deployed on OPS?

Build procedure described already in eniab repository.


EXECSUM status:
--------------
The requirement was to add sections EDS (Executive Data Summary), EPS
(Executive Product Summary) and EPOS (Executive Performance and
Operational Summary) both as new sections for the EXECSUM product and
as standalone products.  The requirements were never put in writing
but instead resulted from a series of email exchanges between Robert
Werzi and me.
---
I attach the current templates for EXECSUM, EPS, EDS and EPOS, as well
as the old EXECSUM template (prior to any of these changes). I also
attach samples for the current EXECSUM, EPS, EDS and EPOS products, as
well as for the old EXECSUM product.

In my opinion, we cannot simply "revert" to the old EXECSUM product
because too many improvements have been done.

The simplest way forward is to take the current EXECSUM product and
cross the information you (meaning the whole CTBTO team, including
Alexander) don't want there. For instance, the availability data, that
we retrieve from the KPI site, is not particularly good and not easy
to interpret: it could be removed, in my opinion.

Once everybody agrees on what should stay and what should go, I can
delete the unwanted information from the EXECSUM template, and remove
the EDS, EPS and EPOS products.

Z:\Projects\VDMS\SEISAN_cleanup_release_preparation

---
There is no documentation but let let me describe the implementation
in a few words: I have implemented a Python script which retrieves
data from 2 sources: the file system and the KPI server. This data is
retrieved once a day with a cron job and saved in our database. When
users request EXECSUM, EDS, EPS or EPOS products, we use data from our
database to create the product.


---
I do not have much in the way of specifications regarding DLSEED. There is a document that Wolfgang had sent me (I attach it)

If a user requests:
BEGIN IMS2.0
MSG_TYPE REQUEST
MSG_ID test_dlseed
STA_LIST ARCES
CHAN_LIST BHF
STA_INFO IMS2.0:DLSEED
STOP
Then, instead of the usual command:
css2inv --osdb user:pwd@odb --schemas STATIC ARCES
I need to execute:
css2inv --osdb user:pwd@odb --schemas STATIC ARCES | inv2dlsv

The DLSEED output is not particularly readable (a sample output is attached to this email).

---
removal of regional screening

In screened bulletins (SEB and SSEB) there was a Regional Screening
section. Apparently the data was not good and/or not relevant so Elena
asked me to remove it.  This is not a new product. I do not have any
documentation.

---
new Category criteria for some radionuclide products (ARR, RRR, ARR_html, RRR_html, SPHD, SPHF)
ARR, RRR, ARR_html, RRR_html, SPHD, SPHF are all standard CTBTO products. If you want to know what these abbreviations mean, you can check the Format & Protocols.
What is important here is that ARR, RRR, SPHD and SPHF are particulate products, while ARR_html and RRR_html are noble gaz products (their output are in HTML, hence the name).
These products list events which have a category. This category denotes how important the event is.
Note that for particulate products (ARR, RRR, SPHD, SPHF), the categories are numbers (1,2,3,4,5) whereas for noble gaz products (ARR_html, RRR_html) there are letters (A,B,C).
When you request these products, you can now add a Category criteria. Here is an example for a SPHD (the new criteria is highlighted in red):

begin ims1.0
msg_type request
msg_id ex026
time 1999/07/01 to 2000/08/01
sta_list AU*
CATEGORY 4,5
sphdf rms2.0
sphdp rms2.0
stop

The criteria will restrict the results to these categories.

---
Actually, I looked it up on OPS and this product has already been deployed.
But anyway: this product is a SSREB (Standard Screened Radionuclide Event Bulletin) for noble gaz stations. Its output is in HTML.
You can request it like this:

BEGIN IMS2.0
MSG_TYPE REQUEST
MSG_ID test_ssreb2
TIME 2019/12/01 to 2019/12/30
STA_LIST *
SSREB IMS2.0:HTML
STOP

I attach a sample response.
2. PKI C&C

PKI C&C is a Django/Python server that manages the lifecycle of new
PKI certificates for stations. It is in final testing (it works with
admin role, but needs to be tested with the various roles: station
operators, CA admin, etc.).

It also interacts with the UPI backend through a small Java server
called CCUPI.

The test instance of PKI C&C is installed in the DMZ, on a VM called
alv326. Nobody knows much about PKI C&C except Edward and I. The PKI
C&C server aims to replace a manual exchange of emails that Edward was
handling with a script before.

Luke Preston is Verizon contractor. He manages UPI dev and
maintenance. His email address is luke.preston@uk.verizon.com but I
would talk with Florin before contacting him.

There is no PKI C&C infrastructure document. I should write one once
the testing is finished.

Our repository:
https://github.com/ctbtosa/pki-command-control
(quite row again - will need more cleanup)

Give me customers contacts to internal CTBOT persons who will use PKi C&C systems – including their roles

Marina: marina.MALAKHOVA@ctbto.org
The station operators (I have only dealt with Vladimir, who is the station operator for Vienna: vladimir.GELASHVILI@ctbto.org)
The PTS CA administrator: I have never been in contact with him or her.

# Notes of PKI C&C requirements
Q1. What means abrevation UPI? (not explained in the document)
A1, It is a question for Luke. I think it means Unified PKI Infrastructure. This is an acronym from Verizon.

Q2. SO email address is 'station operator' email address?
It means PKI C&C is integrated also with DOTS?
A2. Yes. Yes, it uses the DOTS database.

Q3. Station operators are generating key-pair? What is actually key-pair?

A3. Yes, they generate a public/private keypair and a CSR (Certificate
    Signing Request). For more explanation, you can look at PKI on
    Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure.

Q4. Who is PTS CA and what is their role in overall station maintainenance?
A4. I don't know the name of the PTS Certificate Authority, but it is
    the person in charge of approving the new certificates. Certificate
    Authorities use their private key to sign the CSRs and generate the
    new certificates.

Q5. In UC2 there is mentioned 'stakeholders list in the database', who are stakeholders
    and which database is used to store them?
A5. It is users who have an interest in following a particular
    station. The DOTs database has a list of them.

Q6. UC5 - Keypair started reponse - what does this use case in whole workflow?
    In the survey diagram this action actually records the status in 'KPS record DB'.
    Is this happening also in the new PKI C&C system?
A6. I do not understand this question. Could you rephrase it? Or else
    we can discuss before the meeting.

Q7. UC6 Abort pending process - is TBD - has it been implemented, shall we test it?
A7. Yes it has been implemented. There is a button on the homepage.

Q8. What about UC7 to UC10 which have note 'Work in progress' - has it been specified
    and implemented? Shall we test it?
A8. I only see UC7, UC8 and UC9 on my document (v0.8 with Edward comments).
    None of those has been implemented.

Q9. CRL - Certificate Revocation List - what is it and where it resides, who make changes there?
    (In UC7 it is supposed to be a file).
A9. CRLs in a PKI infrastructure are lists of certificates that have
    been revoked. For the moment they have not been implemented.

Q10. The PKI C&C system integrates at least with PKI system and with DOTS.
     Do we have available the latest API documentation, can I have it?

A10. It integrates with the UPI server (through the CCUPI server, a
     small Java server that we provide) and the DOTs database. There is
     also a KeyPairDaemon which checks the LDAP server on a regular basis
     for new certificates.
     I will provide you with an architecture diagram.
     What do you mean by API in this context?

Q11. Where is logging of PKI C&C, is it using syslog? I did not find anything which seems to be log of
     the current PKI C&C portal on devlan.

A11. I think it is in /apps/pkicc/LOG.
     I should have access when I receive my token and will be able to tell you more.

Q12. CC_Portal is using DB, could I have credentails to have a look on the
    schema and data there? Where are they stored in the configuration?

AQ12: I have investigated on alv326,
      /apps/etc/httpd/conf.d/pkicc.conf
      and could connect to the pkicc database:
      > psql -h essai.db.ctbto.org -d arena -U pkicc -W
      and using the password from there.
      Probably issue with permissions:
      arena=> SELECT * FROM CC_USERS;
      ERROR:  relation "cc_users" does not exist
      ----
      Cyrille's answer:
      No, it is because you are in the wrong schema and Postgres does not allow upper case without quotes.
      If you do:
      SET search_path=pkicc;
      SELECT * from "CC_USERS";
      It should work.

      Django uses a SQLite database located in /apps/pkicc/cc_portal/database/
      You can look at the data if you want but you should not have to change or maintain it in any way.

# Additional technical records comming from meeting with Cyrille and Luke on 29.1.2020
There was missing running start_keypair_daemon_runner.py
This was the command supposed to be executed by Cyrille:
> source /apps/pkicc/env/cc_portal.env && export CONF_FILE=/apps/pkicc/conf/start_keypair_daemon.conf && /apps/pkicc/bin/python /apps/pkicc/bin/start_keypair_daemon_runner.py

Listing of certificates stored in the local server:
> ldapsearch -x -h pkildap16.test.ctbto.org -b "l=VIP00,ou=Data Authenticators,ou=IMS,o=ctbto" objectclass=*
Testing of validity of the certificate:
> openssl x509 -in ~/VIP00_cert -inform PEM -text


# PKI C&C Meeting minutes of todays meeting
PKI C&C presentation of implemented use cases deployed to devlan (DMZ4, DMZ5)
29.1.2020
Present:
Tryggvi Edwald - taking over management of the project
Galaftion Florin - information security manager
Cyrille Bonnet - developer of PKI C&C portal
Luke Preston - specialist of PKI system and contributor to integration

Informed: Edward Wokabi (Jan just temporally stands his role)
Vlado Gelashvili and Megan Slingard - SA unit head

Goals of the meeting was to:
A. present functional use and already implemented use cases of PKI C&C portal
B. For Jan to learn about the project status

Cyrille started with conducting presentation of the system.
There were several issues:
1. Malformed CSR request caused error which was vague to undestand - addressed by development task
to implement more robust error handling <link to ticket>.
2. After submittion of valid CSR, the use case could not continue due to
"UPI server was switched to 'manual approval' and therefore did not return valid certificate"
Meanwhile we learned that there is one more process running on 'bonnet' account
start_keypair_daemon_runner which was missing and Jan could not launch it on his account.
(yet running from crontab as background process - not very fortunate).

On 'bonnet' account was running yet another process - CCUPI - java wrapper for UPI API.

Luke has in the afternoon arranged on the UPI server automatic submission of certificates.
Then we checked in LDAP of alv326 that very probably certificate was synchronized.
(Not really confirmed).

Cyrrile in the afternoon received his VPN token and finally can investigate
all circumstances.
However, wrapping the status up - we do not have system ready for testing or presentation and there is
integration/fixing work ahead of us.

Jan has asked about the staus of development of requirements and learned that
Use Cases UC7-UC10 from CTBTO-PKI CC_requirements-v0.11
have not been specified nor implemented - needs clarification about the status.
UC7 - User requests UPDATE_CRL (WIP)
UC8 - User notifies CRL_UPDATED (WIP)
UC9 - User generates report (WIP)
UC10 - User manages the list of notified recipients

---
Follow up - todo list:
Requirements -
It is needed to meet with the person reponsible for requirements and clarify missing use cases
- Jan to meet with Malakhova Marina and try to discuss it.

Architecture desing:
Would be good to think about crontab components, and how each process is started, stoped and monitored.
We need to have dedicated technical account on alv326 and the system deployed under technica account.
We need to prepare for rollout to APS by means of collecting documentaiton, installation procedures,
well documented configuration, testing and verification procedures.
Then we need additional machine to set up instance maintained and isntalled by APS (processing engineers) via a DCR.
(I have spoken with Alexander Sudakov - the system has to ready to be accepted by APS before doing this.)

Testing:
First we need test plan and established roles and test cases for involved people.
I have visited also Vlado Gelashvili - he will support us by creating valid CSR requests.
We need to test also error scenarios - test plan and first round of testing will be conducted by Cyrille.
We need to verify integration with PKI and UPI server next week when Luke is arround to support us.
