A lot is in GitHub issues and wiki page - there are more than 100 issues, most of them are closed.

Interesting is also cats/build/generic-build-and-test-launcher.sh with
its comprehensive header description.

Meeting with Thomas on 2.4.2019:
Just a few important notes we were talking about:
- we have now two instance of CATS, each maintained by different persons - TST/OPS and DEV - Thomas/Kainda
- we have not also interactive application tested using Sikulix -
- we have agreed on making me accessible the OPS cats by providing you with my ssh key (Done already - thank you)
- there are still jobs which produces randomly wrong results, one of them was just ordering on application level
  revealed during porting to RH 6.10 and there are some more. We will dig into these in near future.
- Jenkins is not fully integrated into CODs and Jira project to support full workflow
- Ilia Dricker is working on different memory leaks revealed during system testing.
- there COD pipeline for CDTools, plugging for nexus did not work, calling of REST api is used instead
  See the job configuration cdtools-master-db-unit-deploy. 
- there is also a Docker usage under investigation - have a look on docker-test2 - it is testing already
  RH 7.5. It is possible to connect via VNC and see the started ARS.
  (I will like to have a closer look on this work.)
- there is pending fix for ampid issue already developed and tested by Zuehlke guys (see SIM-681),
  On quick look I do not see it included into a release DRC nor any DCR has been prepared yet.


Recorded answers after meeting with Thomas on 9.4.2019.
Questions:
CATS_Q1: what means 'staging pipeline' and what role it has in CATS?
A_Q1: Staging area is basically the devLAB environment, used for preparing new black-box test or new version of the test.
      There are for example two devLAB machines - devlab01, devlab02 used for cdtools running in separate environment.
      Albert Brower was using his 'staging area' to develop new bbox test in:
      /dvlscratch/SHI/brouwer/run_for_maxpmf/

CATS_Q2: Are there some scheme files in cats repo still?
A_Q2: Not any more, all scheme files are deployed from ibase so far.
      There is ongoing effort to split the ibase repository to four repositories, which are already placed on GitHUB:
      git@github.com:ctbtosa/shi-automatic.git - for automatic tools
      git@github.com:ctbtosa/shi-interactive.git - for interactive tools
      git@github.com:ctbtosa/ibase-widgets.git - libraries for interactive applications only
      git@github.com:ctbtosa/ibase.git - stripped out ibase (probably master branch)
      git@github.com:ctbtosa/dfx.git - stripped out DFX only
      Find out if this effort is scheduled and whether it has a DCR already.      

CATS_Q3: Configuring of pipeline which communicate between Jenkins and GitHUB is done by means of 'Blue Ocean' plugin?
         By what means, how it is possible to integrate without SSL certification and encryption of HTTP protocol?
         What is the current pipeline say for ibase and how is it configured?
A_Q3: Blue Ocean on OPS machine is not used, there is just an experimental pipeline for cbase.
      However, Kainda on DEV machine is using it intenzivelly.

CATS_Q4: I have by chance noticed that generated pdf does not match with GitHub wiki - for example
         Could not find whole chapter titled "Testing Interactive Applications".
A_Q4: The cats.pdf was updated by Thomas in the 'cats' repo.
      There is cats/doc/buil.sh script, which has to be extended in case new chapter on wiki appears.

CATS_Q5: How looks like Jira tickets of CATS - A. when released version fails, B. when developers version fails.
A_Q5: Publishing of Jira tickets was turned off and there were issues with customized Plugins (Jira-plugin).
      Automatically generated Jira issue looks like e.g.:
      http://its.ctbto.org/browse/CATSDEVEL-2266 - from DEV instance - there is only cats hash and basically no information availble
      http://its.ctbto.org/browse/CATSPROD-298 - from OPS instance where is summary description, but are missing more details
      of failed test.
      There is remark by Hemluth, that email notifications is enough and Jira tickets shall be created latter by hand.
      However, whole this integration is part of the system, and for continuous integration of operation version
      of the system would be good to have ticket generation automation on place - generating of high priority issues.


CATS_Q6: For developers when system black/box tests are running, how are maintained the reference data, eventually 
         new input data.
A_Q6: As a reference results any 'commitish' object from the internal ctbto 'cats-data-robot' can be used.
      Currently there are only a few branches in use, but in repository there is 48 branches.
      We can consider cleanup and removing some of the branches.
      For playing arround and development of changes which modifies results is good to use local instance,
      copy robot data to reference targets and use manuall comparisions. Only after deliver submit DCR to include
      new version of robot results to the git repository.

CATS_Q7: Have you ever tried to use the cats_pipeline repository, where is described the procedure.
         Is anyhow addressed this TODO from Albert
         Consider creating a manageable alternative such as an extension of the Station Tuning framework.
A_Q7: cats_pipeline repository was not really used - it is supposed to be used for preparing of data for different new bbox tests.
      Albert have used this pipeline for maxpmf implementation.
      Otherwise it is possible to get input data directly from dvl system, or from archive from a representative event.
      Have a look also on Station Tuning Framework implemented yet by Albert. It is available:
      gitadm@git.ctbto.org:station_tuning
      It is basically CATS but with normal Oracle database accessed as so called QANDEF snapshot.
      See readme file.  

CATS_Q8: As I remember, there was such mechanism in Black-box tests, that by each run
         full Oracle instance was reinstalled - bundled/unbundled - is this still valid, or
         bundling/unbundling takes place only during installation?
A_Q8: Yes, by each run the Oracle XE is reinstalled locally.

CATS_Q9: Do you know something about Jenkins jobs ssi-test? It is failing and I do not have permission
         to see the GitHUB repository ctbtosa/ssi-builder.git
A_Q9: This job is very likelly obsolete anymore. Thomas will confirm with stackeholders and move it to 'old' tab.

CATS_Q10: There is DFX stand alone repository in GitHUB. It appears as an effort to split the ibase repository
          vertically - by application. Was this effort finished and we have the DFX application in a separate 
          repository?
A_Q10: Yes, the effort of splitting took place - see answer to Q2.

CATS_Q11: How it is with Git LFS repositories.  It looks like Git lfs
          is not part of the linux baseline, I do not have it available
          on my linux workstation.
          On CATS operation machines as user cats I do not have permission to execute git lfs.
          > [cats@alv207 targets]$ pwd
          /apps/data/robot/targets
          [cats@alv207 targets]$ git lfs env
          fatal: cannot exec 'git-lfs': Permission denied
          Who and how is actually executing the clones and checkouts - everything is owned by cats user.

          Also looks like repository 'cats-data-robot' was moved from
          GitHUB to CTBTO git and Git LFS is not use for this repo
          anymore.
A_Q11: In order to have available GIT LFS local cats's git has to be used by this means:
       [cats@alv200 targets]$ source ~/.catsrc
       (python)[cats@alv200 targets]$ which git
       /apps/bin/git/bin/git

CATS_Q12: I see that robot results and different workspace artifacts are collected
          to the master Jenkins machine:
          /apps/data/jenkins
          in a directory tree with runs:
          [cats@tlv109 jenkins]$ ls jobs/ibase-github-zuehlke-devel-cbase/builds/
          100  102  104  106  108  110  92  94  96  98  lastFailedBuild  lastSuccessfulBuild  lastUnsuccessfulBuild
          101  103  105  107  109  111  93  95  97  99  lastStableBuild  lastUnstableBuild    legacyIds
          This single jobs has up to 1.7GB.         
          The robot results are displayed in the browser:
          http://cats.ctbto.org:8080/view/Z%C3%BChlke/job/ibase-github-zuehlke-devel-cbase/96/robot/report/report.html
          but I have to add CSP - content security policy exception.
          Where there is such vulnerability?
          It looks there is executed some outer content in Jenkins or is there running some other web server?
          can not we somehow fix this issue of displaying the results?
A_Q12: There is set limit for 'thin backups' to only four weeks, and on the master Jenkins machine, there is enough
       disk space.
       Might be problem with some slaves. Some of the jobs have now specified nodes where they can run, and
       this preserves the disk occupation.
       However, some cleanup would not be bad.
       Regarding CSP security issue, Thomas has no clue why there is this problem, and does not use Robot results,
       but works directly with results on the machines.


CATS_Q13: How can I download the artifacts from operational Nexus repository:
          nexus01.test.ctbto.org
          (I have looked on your COD job - cdtools-master-db-unit-deploy, and there in the execute shell
           there are stored credentials through which I can access the nexus repository.)
A_13: Test(dev) nexus repository (which is currently integrated e.g. for cdtools) does not have limited permissions.
      Now operational Nexus requires authentification for downloading artifacts.
      TEST(DEV) instance: http://nexus01.test.ctbto.org:8081/
      OPS: https://nexus.ctbto.org/

CATS_Q14: There is full backup of jenkins workspace by each weekend and deletion done automatically.
          This is driven by configuration of the Thin backup plugin.
          I was about to ask some details, if you maintain these backups or if you ever had to recover
          Jenkins from the backup files.
A_14: Yes, thin pluging is configured such that holds only last four one-week backups.
      There was issue during upgrade of Jenkins attempt when some of the resources had to be recovered from backup.
      Kainda has worked out the procedure for correct upgrade of Jenkins

CATS_Q15: Generated Jira tickets are send to this Jira from the production machine:
          http://its.ctbto.org/projects/CATSPROD
          However, browsing the issues, I see some CATSPROD tasks for
          cdtools - all of them created and put to state resolved.
          And a lot of bugs all of them also closed. Reporting shows there were no issues created in last months.
          Is actually this automatic mechanism already used for development/production testing?
          If possible could you give me some details how and where the publishing is configured in CATS?
A_15: As replied before, this mechanism is not used nor configured.
      It is possible to configure publishing and format of the Jira ticket contend by each job of Jenkins 
      by means of Jira-plugin.

CATS_Q16: The same is valid for 
          http://its.ctbto.org/projects/CATSDEVEL/
          when executing report with newly created issues, nothing is open. 
          Does it work, is it functional? 
          There is list of open issues, but they are not assigned to anyone and are quite old.
A_16: As replied before, it is not on place any more.

Inputs for planning:
1. According Albert's notes, we have two instances of CATS:
   dev - dlv020 - now responsible for this instance is Kainda Daka.
   tst,ops - tlv112 - responsible is currently still Thomas Fabian

2. From Albert's documentation there is one big toto - for development of the new tests:
   Consider creating a manageable alternative such as an extension of the Station Tuning framework.

Farhter set of questions to Thomas:
CATS_Q17: I see that in operations CATS there are no credentials used to authenticate to GitHUB nor to internatl CTBTO git server.
          This means that Jenkins is running under user 'cats' which have direct access to these services?
          In credential part there are several entries for user cats, admin, jenkins, catstest. 
          How are these used, are they used to communicate with external services like Jira, workers or GitHUB via Https?
A_17:
Yes, authentification to CTBTOSA github and CTBTO git server is realized by ssh key on system level.
jenkins user is used for Nexus, and 'catstest' is used for Jira, which is turned off.
admin?? 'jenkins' users are many, because we do not know which is the actual one in use.
There is room for cleanup and improvement here.

CATS_Q18: For development purpose what ssh keys are you using for work with GitHUB and 'cats' user?
A_18: Yes, we use it like this, there will be issue with cats-data-robot, we will need two keys for authentication.

CATS_Q19: Have you got your RH 7 worker with IDC baseline? Can we get the list of packages from somewhere?
When running the install baseline script, I have a lot of "No package" of the name available.
A_19: Yes, the machine was set up with IDC baseline, you can request the list from IDC system administrator.
Thomas recalls that during set up of his machine, there was issue with only one package which had to be removed 
from the list - Centos 6.x.

CATS_Q20: I would like to have fully green unit tests, blackbox tests and all tests for 'operations' version of
SHI software - particularly ibase and its dependencies.
Could you help me if such job is already configured?
I see mostly just GitHUB development configurations with 'master' branches and even split ibase repository.
Plus, do we have tagged configuration versions which can be checked out from ctbto git server?
Plus which is the right committish of cats-data-robot repo for such verification job?
A_20: This is an issue - cats development by Thomas and others did not reflect the backward
compatibility. Regarding cats-data-robot comittish, this corresponds mostly to the branch
'github-master-reference-quick' but even the reference job on CATS OPS have ended up
as unstable with failing tests.
We have decided to implement backward compatibility to be capable to test also
current 'operations' version of ibase.


CATS_Q21: If I want to run black box tests locally from command line
and want to use my own clones of config repositories, how to do that
and how it works, could you show me then?
A_21: Whereas Thomas does not have direct access to CTBTO internal Git,
he does clones and copies them locally.
I have switched by local 'cats' user on dev machine to use my own ssh keys and thus
have access by means of cats automation also to configuration repositories.

CATS_Q22: Question about RH 6.10 and RH 7 workers - what was the approach to specify the baseline.
I see you have referenced in the ticket SD-5375 ATM server plus there is the small list for support
of interactive applications:
"for testing of interactive applications the following packages are installed: epel-release, wmctrl, xdotool, tesseract-devel"
My impression is that one of the major goals is to support testing for NDC-in-box,
does this project have some baseline for the Centos 7 VMs?
Plus, did you have to add some packages for the baseline for normal RH 6.10 workers when they were upgraded?
A_22: I did not request adding packages after the upgrade to
6.10. Only for geotoolqt testing I requested additional packages but I
can not remember exactly if it was before or after upgrading, I
beleave it was before, I can search the ticket in Jira.  When I
requested the RH7 VM there was no baseline defined ad therefore it got
stuck and the VM was not provided because the asked me to define a
baseline which I can not do. But Martin told me that he got VMs with
RH 7 and therefore I told Balazs he should do it like he did for
ATM. I expect that several packages might be missing, but this will
turn out when the migration work starts.
For RH 6.10 was requested VNC in addition - for verification of
interactive tests.


CATS_Q23: During troubleshooting of bbox tests on my local dev machine, when I frogot to make reload of oracle scheme, I had this error when running local test DFX-origamp:
---
IMP-00015: following statement failed because the object already exists:
 "CREATE TABLE "AMPID_USED" ("AMPID" NUMBER(10, 0) NOT NULL ENABLE)  PCTFREE "
 "10 PCTUSED 40 INITRANS 1 MAXTRANS 255 STORAGE(INITIAL 65536 NEXT 1048576 MI"
 "NEXTENTS 1 FREELISTS 1 FREELIST GROUPS 1 BUFFER_POOL DEFAULT)              "
 "      LOGGING NOCOMPRESS"
Import terminated successfully with warnings.

 SQL> create or replace type IDC_ID as
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-02303: cannot drop or replace a type with type or table dependents
---
I percive there is implemented the solution for ampid overflow, which is also just pending development.
Could you give me some more details?
My concern is how this new feature is implemented and whether we can reliably test the sofware
which does not implement yet workaround for ampid overflow?

A_23: The stored procedure that is used for that is installed in the
database before running the test and removed after the test. This is
done in the run.sh script for each test that uses this method.
cats/oracle/createStoredProcedureLastid.sh
cats/oracle/removeStoredProcedureLastid.sh
Called in these tests:
blackbox/tests/shi-automatic/maxpmf/run.sh
blackbox/tests/shi-automatic/IDC_Pipeline/run.sh
blackbox/tests/dfx/DFX-detection/run.sh
blackbox/tests/dfx/DFX-noiseamp/run.sh
blackbox/tests/dfx/DFX-origamp/run.sh
blackbox/tests/dfx/DFX-evch/run.sh
blackbox/tests/dfx/DFX-recall/run.sh
This change is backward compatible with the operations software version,
bacause there is no modification of DB interface, just extension.

CATS_Q24: When trying to run the bbox tests with the new sofware on Friday, it ended up with
the failing test:
/home/cats/workspace1/shiscripts/bin/start program=analyst_log
/home/cats/workspace1/shiscripts/bin/start: Command not found.
sleep 10
+ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/apps/bin/opencv/install/lib
+ /apps/bin/sikulix/runsikulix -r analyst_log.sikuli
./analyst_log/run.sh: line 69: /apps/bin/sikulix/runsikulix: No such file or directory
+ import -compress jpeg -window root analyst_log_after.jpg
+ exit 1

which means running bbox test impicitelly includes also interactive tests.
I though it is somehow separated that I should be capable to run just back-end blackbox tests.
A_24: At first Thomas have thought to separate GUI tests by having
different bbox tests names - runGUI.sh, but latter decided to
incorporate them as bbox tests.  Yes, this is correct. The test of
interactive applications are run by default and part of our continuous
integration jobs. It sould be described in the documentation how to
set up Sikulix. If you want to run a subset of the tests you can used
the RUN_BLACKBOX_TESTS_REGEXP variable.

CATS_Q25: I have executed manually 'ibase-github-master-reference-quick' on OPS CATS instance.
However, there were several test which have failure - particularly
DFX-detection-seismic-20160106-quick - which has different number of records in Apma table
dtk-pmcc - which actually did not produce any output
You already claim that quick tests should have no failures. What is the correct configration
of the job to reach such status?
A_25: DFX-detaction is known issue which was resolved by decision to
limit number of output arrivals and regenerate the reference in
'cats-data-robot'repository.  But issue with dtk-pmcc is bigger, it
just does not work with latest release to github, which is quite big
release. Many tousands files changed.  Thomas has modified the
reference job to point to the certain version of dtk-pmcc in past to
have the green status.
Thomas reply: As discussed in the standup meetings the difference in
the Apma table for DFX detection is due to
https://itscore.ctbto.org/browse/SIM-969 I have to update the target
results but did not do it yet because the DTk-PMCC tests are not
working at the moment (after the the latests update of the DTK-pmcc
code. This is covered by
https://itscore.ctbto.org/browse/SIM-1064. Unfortunately I don’t see
how to fix it at the moment. I will probably use an older revision of
DTK-Pmcc to update the target results.

CATS_Q26: During rebuild I have this issue with latest ibase:
---
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
	libsrc/libidcbeamrecipe/test/Makefile.am
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
---
From the makefile was removed TESTS_ENVIRONMENT and TESTS variables.
How could this be, which process has done it?
A_26: This is overcame by having in each job wipping of whole code
repo from the workspace. Would be good to extend the generic builder
and runer script.

CATS_Q27: I have attempted to run extended tests of libwaveformqc, but have impression it is
not even supported. Have this error:
---
Libwaveformqc_in_DFX_Tests::performqc2_persistqc1_qc_waveforms_allError: Could not find or load main class org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher
 : assertion
Libwaveformqc_in_DFX_Tests::performqc2_persistqc1_transaction_rollbackQSqlQuery::prepare: database not open
"QODBCResult::exec: No statement handle available" 	Error: " [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Can't open lib '/var/tmp/cats/bin/oracle/product/11.2.0/xe/lib/libsqora.so.11.1'
---
But can not track correct setup of input configuration into 'make check' command.
See ibase/README and one also in dfx as I recall.
---
$ make check TEST_DB_USER="user" TEST_DB_PWD="pwd"

        optional parameters 
        - TEST_DB_SID - SID of the database (default="udb")
        - TEST_DB_DSN - DSN of the database (default="udb")
A_27: This an observer issue of backward compatibility of the CATS system.
With client version 12.2 this test works. But it was proved that Oracle 11.2.0
is not longer functional when running DB_UNIT_TESTS.

CATS_Q28. There is instantly failing unit test in cbase in libstdtime, why it is not fixed and all
related jobs put to zero failure tolerance?
Also why there are disabled also tests in ibase/libsrc/libidcbeamrecipe by patching in the generic builder script?
A_28: libstdtime is fixed in github master. Jobs that use gihub the tolerance should be set to zero.
For libidcbeamrecipe Thomas is not aware of the reason and whether the issue is still there.
We should open the ticket to investigate this unit tests.

CATS_Q29: Looks like there is something wrong with the job - cdtools-master-noodbc-unit.
It was executed on cats-worker06-database-RH7 node, where we know unit test do not run correctly.
This is obvious also from latest log file.
However, build is green. And we should exclude RH 7 node from operational use yet.
A_29: we have fixed this configuration to exlude RH7 node from the list.

CATS_Q30; docker-test2 - is running in the docker container 'docker_slave' which looks lile is
temporally creating a docker image for example in last ran was called docker_slave-0005byiji4pz2 on docker_slave
and has created temporal workspace in:
/apps/data/workdir/workspace/docker-test2
which I did not found on any of the workers.
This means the workspace is removed after successfull run? In this case I do not have possibility to return to the
workspace for investigations.
How can I found on which physical worker was actually the jobs executed?
A_30: In general system configuration in Jenkins, there is block:
Cloud - Docker, which establishes the connection to 192.168.17.2:2375
which is devlab02.
There is installed docker and is set up such that 40 GB docker container can run there.
(This integration should be recorder in the deployment diagram).
There is also difference that docker runs under user 'jenkins, therefore in order to investigate
we have to connect to devlab02 as jenkins:
> ssh jenkins@devlab02
Listing of current processes:
> sudo docker ps
Listing of docker images:
> sudo docker image ls
Ours is this one:
REPOSITORY                                        TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
...
jenkins-ssh-slave                                 latest              792fe224900b        3 months ago        41.4 GB
...
residing on the file system:
/dev/mapper/alv607-docker                         100G   59G   42G  59% /var/lib/docker

CATS_Q31: Why for some jobs is removed ibase/libsrc/libidclog before SCM runs?
A_31: There were issues with libidclog - therefore for some jobs it had to be removed due to segfault.
Instance of two threads were used 30. Then different error was happing - still and error, files with
invalid names - jenkins was not able to delete such files - this was workaround.
SIM-1001, SIM-574, SIM-1043, SIM-785.
This issues are fix in github master. But in operational system the library is prob. not used in the multithreaded environment.
There is still one issue in the backlog.

CATS_Q32:There is a bit scarry appearing job configured by Wolgang Sommerer -
niab-config-cats - mixing ctbto-git, github versions and different
branches of different code and config repositories.
And moreover implementing various hacks in shell. Switching oracle client versions
for certain actions.
Is this how software is delivered to NDCs?
Why there are such hacks and how can NDCs use two versions of Oracle clients?
Why there is no strightforwrd dependency - say we deliver 'testbed' or 'operiations' version of the sofware - or some special release clearly tagged?
A_32: Would be good to let ENIAB jobs to life their own life in the CATS.
For time being not to fully support in e.g. generic builder script.
They can decide about versions and branches.

CATS_Q33: For some jobs there is used CTBTO-git version of 'cats' repository instead of
github version. Why and what is the difference. Should we not always use just Github version?
A_33: Thomas is keeping internal CTBTO cats repository
up-to-date. First verifies the changes in cats repo in GitHUB and then
pushes it to CTBTO internal server. There should be more stable and
functional version.  Also aspect of automatically triggering by SCM
change of two many jobs is considered here.

CATS_Q34: In the job 'seiscomp3-github-cats' in additon to supported set of repos 
also eniab and seiscomp3 repositories are build. Do we have some policy which and
how new reposities are included into generic-build-and-test-launcher.sh?
A_34: eniab and seiscomp3 for time beeing will not be covered by the cats build scripts.
Wolfgnag will have full access and responsibility for this Jenkins job.

CATS_Q35: On master node of OPS CATS there is stored backup of 'old_jobs'
/apps/data/jenkins/old_jobs comprising 14GB of diskspace.
Could we do something to gain this disk space?
Do we need this backup of the old jobs with their builds?
A_35: Thomas has cleaned this directory a little bit and compressed the jobs workspaces.

CATS_Q36: Why we have in gbase and geotool special 'cats' branch and do not maintain
GitHUB master branch to be compatible e.g. with master branch in ibase and ibase-widgets?
TODO here - contact HE regarding these tests he has implemented and also Wolfgang Sommerer why
we can not keep just master branch.
A_36: This question remains open - we have to talk about this and tests with Wolfgang.

CATS_Q37: Why for GeotoolQT is used master branch of gbase and for geotool 'cats' branch as mentioned in the previous
question?
A_37: Again question to Wolfgang.


Requested workers for DEV instance
RH 6.10 worker node for DEV CATS
---------------------------------
Dear System Administrator, dear CTBTO Service Desk,
I would like to request new worker node for Development instance of Continuous Automated Testing System (CATS) which has now only one shared master/slave worker: dlv020. 
It should be RedHat 6.10 corresponding to pending RedHat 6 migration with standard IDC baseline installed.
In addition for interactive applications testing we need:
epel-release, wmctrl, xdotool, tesseract-devel
Would be good, if it corresponds to this worker of the OPS CATS instance: dlv022 
with ~300 GB disk space, 15 GB of memory, 2 proc cores.
We will need to have technical user 'cats' created and given permission to access this user via SSH key authentication to these persons: Thomas Fabian, Kainda Daka, Jan Kianicka.
The new machine will be attached as a worker to DEV CATS's Jenkins: http://dlv020.idc.ctbto.org:8080
If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.
Thank you very much
Jan Kianicka

RH 7 worker node for DEV CATS
-----------------------------
Dear System Administrators, dear CTBTO Service Desk,
I would like to request additional worker node for DEV CATS instance with RH 7 operational system.
This is for future development and supporting in sense of automatic integrated tests for projects NDC-in-the-box and potential deliveries of different IDC software which requires RH 7 version. 
The machine should correspond to already provided RH 7 worker node, but used in Operational (OPS) CATS: alv519
~130 GB disk space, 15 GB memory, 2 proc cores
Regrading installed baseline the new worker should correspond to alv519 plus packages needed for interactive applications testing:
epel-release, wmctrl, xdotool, tesseract-devel
We will need to have technical user 'cats' created and given permission to access this user via SSH key authentication to these persons: Thomas Fabian, Kainda Daka, Jan Kianicka.
The new machine will be attached as a worker to DEV CATS's Jenkins: http://dlv020.idc.ctbto.org:8080
We need this additional node to conduct offensive experiments on CATS DEV whereas alv519 is attached to OPS CATS (http://cats.ctbto.org:8080) which already provides operational service for development teams and soon for Continuous Delivery project.
If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.
Thank you very much
Jan Kianicka
