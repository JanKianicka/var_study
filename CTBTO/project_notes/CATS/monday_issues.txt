Fixes to be implemented:
coverage/install-gcovr.sh
This was just workaround not to execute the version:
virtualenv --system-site-packages
'This can be used if you have control over the global site-packages directory, and you want to depend on the packages there.'

-    if grep -q "6." /etc/redhat-release; then
+    if grep -q "7." /etc/redhat-release; then
         virtualenv  "${CATS_PYTHON_VIRTUALENV}"
     else
To be fully removed this condition, we will have only isolatted python installation without any inheriting 
from global site packages directory.

oracle/unbundle-oracle.sh
-    tar -xvzf "${CATS_ORACLE_TARBALL}" -C "${UNPACKDIR}"
+    tar -xhvzf "${CATS_ORACLE_TARBALL}" -C "${UNPACKDIR}"

Add correct handling also of internal links in the tar ball.

And issue with needed git reset --hard when running multiply times.
Also there is an issue with patching the configuration - point this out too and fix it.
