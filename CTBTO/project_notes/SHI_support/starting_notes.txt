# Here I will record my detail tasks not directly related to a
  particular project.

# 4.4.2019 - I need to put hand on the dev enviroment and to prepare the machine
1. Check linux version
   > [kianicka@dlw003 ~]$ cat /etc/*-release
   LSB_VERSION=base-4.0-amd64:base-4.0-noarch:core-4.0-amd64:core-4.0-noarch:graphics-4.0-amd64:graphics-4.0-noarch:printing-4.0-amd64:printing-4.0-noarch
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 6.10 (Santiago)
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 6.10 (Santiago)
   
   Trying to reach other VMs, succceeded only with
   dvl014 - where actual devlan system is running
   (others either did not exists or I was not authentificated)
   
   python 2.6.6 everywhere
   [kianicka@dlv014 ~]$ gcc --version
   gcc (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-23)
   [kianicka@dlw003 ~]$ gcc --version
   gcc (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-23)

   SQLDeveloper:
   > /cots/oracle/sqldeveloper-17.4.1.054/sqldeveloper.sh
   > path to java: /cots/oracle/java/jdk1.8
     stored to: /home/kianicka/.sqldeveloper/17.4.1/product.conf
   For connections use:
   > ls /cots/oracle/conf/tnsnames.ora
    
   sqlplus:
   > setenv ORACLE_HOME /cots/oracle/oracle-11.2.0.2
   > /cots/oracle/oracle-11.2.0.2/bin/sqlplus idcx/idcx_dev@idcdev
   > select * from wfdisc where rownum < 10;

   Eclipse 
   Default /usr/bin/eclipse is without C/C++ plugin.
   There is still my old eclipse:
   /dvlscratch/RN/kianicka/Software/eclipse/eclipse with PyDEV and C/C++ support
   
   SSH-Keys
   Generate, send to Thomas and Evangelos, register on Github (Done).
   Send.
   But did not succeed with ssh-key authentification.
   Wrong permission to .ssh directory and to authorized keys file.
   This sequence has fixed the problem:
   > chmod 755 .ssh/
   > chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys
   > chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa
   
   Firefox was installed and I did not succeed with local instalaltion of mc.
    
   TODO - move old kianicka artifacts and request Raluca to clean shared folders.

2. Account on parallel computing station and installed numpy and pandas locally using anaconda.
   Now try some nice use case to demonstrate performance of pandas and numpy.
   May be compare with java.

Ampid issue resolution - looks like genial idea from Gleb Kuzmenko:

Questions:
Ibase:
- what is actually in ibase 'master' branch on GitHUB? Why it does not correspond to devlan branch?
- I see that devlan_clean has been abandoned - good:
  dlw003.idc.ctbto.org.-328% git branch -avv | grep devlan
   * devlan                                                           4a7f526 [github/devlan] Merge remote branch 'remotes/origin/hotfix_TST_ICR-1245' into testbed
   remotes/ctbto/devlan                                             4a7f526 Merge remote branch 'remotes/origin/hotfix_TST_ICR-1245' into testbed
   remotes/ctbto/devlan_old                                         3a7ad6b changed directory with ICR-819 script location has been changed
   remotes/github/devlan                                            4a7f526 Merge remote branch 'remotes/origin/hotfix_TST_ICR-1245' into testbed
   remotes/github/devlan_clean                                      d43ba50 Merge remote branch 'remotes/breitenf/DCR-2861' into devlan
  And I see also that devlan corresponds to testbed branch - which shows that new release, porting to RH6.10 is in progress.
  However, reading the Git workflow and seeing the status on ctbto Gitolite, I see that devlan and testbed branches are laging behind operations,
  but there is missing integration 'master' branch which should be ahead of the operation all the time.

  The same for the github repository - in ibase there are several feature branches, but they are not merged to the 'master' branch and 
  it almost look like master/devlan/operations diverge.

  In the described process overview, there is mentioned, that 'each commit object on master is a new release with released version on nexus'.
  In case of cdtools this is valid (cdtools is only on CTBTO Gitolite server - or I do not see the GitHUB repo), 
  but not for dependent libraries, e.g. libcd. Publishing of deployment artifacts to nexus works.

- libcd -
  I see that devlan branch is far byond the testbed and operation branch. The head of development is probably github master branch.
