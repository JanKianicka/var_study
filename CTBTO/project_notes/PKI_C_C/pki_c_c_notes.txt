# Notes during take over of the PKI C&C project

PKI C&C is a Django/Python server that manages the lifecycle of new
PKI certificates for stations. It is in final testing (it works with
admin role, but needs to be tested with the various roles: station
operators, CA admin, etc.).

It also interacts with the UPI backend through a small Java server
called CCUPI.

The test instance of PKI C&C is installed in the DMZ, on a VM called
alv326. Nobody knows much about PKI C&C except Edward and I. The PKI
C&C server aims to replace a manual exchange of emails that Edward was
handling with a script before.

Luke Preston is Verizon contractor. He manages UPI dev and
maintenance. His email address is luke.preston@uk.verizon.com but I
would talk with Florin before contacting him.

There is no PKI C&C infrastructure document. I should write one once
the testing is finished.

Our repository:
https://github.com/ctbtosa/pki-command-control
(quite row again - will need more cleanup)

Give me customers contacts to internal CTBOT persons who will use PKi C&C systems – including their roles

# Notes of PKI C&C requirements
Q1. What means abrevation UPI? (not explained in the document)
A1, It is a question for Luke. I think it means Unified PKI Infrastructure. This is an acronym from Verizon.

Q2. SO email address is 'station operator' email address?
It means PKI C&C is integrated also with DOTS?
A2. Yes. Yes, it uses the DOTS database.

Q3. Station operators are generating key-pair? What is actually key-pair?

A3. Yes, they generate a public/private keypair and a CSR (Certificate
    Signing Request). For more explanation, you can look at PKI on
    Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure.

Q4. Who is PTS CA and what is their role in overall station maintainenance?
A4. I don't know the name of the PTS Certificate Authority, but it is
    the person in charge of approving the new certificates. Certificate
    Authorities use their private key to sign the CSRs and generate the
    new certificates.

Q5. In UC2 there is mentioned 'stakeholders list in the database', who are stakeholders
    and which database is used to store them?
A5. It is users who have an interest in following a particular
    station. The DOTs database has a list of them.

Q6. UC5 - Keypair started reponse - what does this use case in whole workflow?
    In the survey diagram this action actually records the status in 'KPS record DB'.
    Is this happening also in the new PKI C&C system?
A6. I do not understand this question. Could you rephrase it? Or else
    we can discuss before the meeting.

Q7. UC6 Abort pending process - is TBD - has it been implemented, shall we test it?
A7. Yes it has been implemented. There is a button on the homepage.

Q8. What about UC7 to UC10 which have note 'Work in progress' - has it been specified
    and implemented? Shall we test it?
A8. I only see UC7, UC8 and UC9 on my document (v0.8 with Edward comments).
    None of those has been implemented.

Q9. CRL - Certificate Revocation List - what is it and where it resides, who make changes there?
    (In UC7 it is supposed to be a file).
A9. CRLs in a PKI infrastructure are lists of certificates that have
    been revoked. For the moment they have not been implemented.

Q10. The PKI C&C system integrates at least with PKI system and with DOTS.
     Do we have available the latest API documentation, can I have it?

A10. It integrates with the UPI server (through the CCUPI server, a
     small Java server that we provide) and the DOTs database. There is
     also a KeyPairDaemon which checks the LDAP server on a regular basis
     for new certificates.
     I will provide you with an architecture diagram.
     What do you mean by API in this context?

Q11. Where is logging of PKI C&C, is it using syslog? I did not find anything which seems to be log of
     the current PKI C&C portal on devlan.

A11. I think it is in /apps/pkicc/LOG.
     I should have access when I receive my token and will be able to tell you more.

Q12. CC_Portal is using DB, could I have credentails to have a look on the
    schema and data there? Where are they stored in the configuration?

AQ12: I have investigated on alv326,
      /apps/etc/httpd/conf.d/pkicc.conf
      and could connect to the pkicc database:
      > psql -h essai.db.ctbto.org -d arena -U pkicc -W
      and using the password from there.
      Probably issue with permissions:
      arena=> SELECT * FROM CC_USERS;
      ERROR:  relation "cc_users" does not exist
      ----
      Cyrille's answer:
      No, it is because you are in the wrong schema and Postgres does not allow upper case without quotes.
      If you do:
      SET search_path=pkicc;
      SELECT * from "CC_USERS";
      It should work.

      Django uses a SQLite database located in /apps/pkicc/cc_portal/database/
      You can look at the data if you want but you should not have to change or maintain it in any way.

# Additional technical records comming from meeting with Cyrille and Luke on 29.1.2020
There was missing running start_keypair_daemon_runner.py
This was the command supposed to be executed by Cyrille:
> source /apps/pkicc/env/cc_portal.env && export CONF_FILE=/apps/pkicc/conf/start_keypair_daemon.conf && /apps/pkicc/bin/python /apps/pkicc/bin/start_keypair_daemon_runner.py

Listing of certificates stored in the local server:
> ldapsearch -x -h pkildap16.test.ctbto.org -b "l=VIP00,ou=Data Authenticators,ou=IMS,o=ctbto" objectcla
Testing of validity of the certificate:
> openssl x509 -in ~/VIP00_cert -inform PEM -text


# PKI C&C Meeting minutes of todays meeting
PKI C&C presentation of implemented use cases deployed to devlan (DMZ4, DMZ5)
29.1.2020
Present:
Tryggvi Edwald - taking over management of the project
Galaftion Florin - information security manager
Cyrille Bonnet - developer of PKI C&C portal
Luke Preston - specialist of PKI system and contributor to integration

Informed: Edward Wokabi (Jan just temporally stands his role)
Vlado Gelashvili and Megan Slingard - SA unit head

Goals of the meeting was to:
A. present functional use and already implemented use cases of PKI C&C portal
B. For Jan to learn about the project status

Cyrille started with conducting presentation of the system.
There were several issues:
1. Malformed CSR request caused error which was vague to undestand - addressed by development task
to implement more robust error handling <link to ticket>.
2. After submittion of valid CSR, the use case could not continue due to
"UPI server was switched to 'manual approval' and therefore did not return valid certificate"
Meanwhile we learned that there is one more process running on 'bonnet' account
start_keypair_daemon_runner which was missing and Jan could not launch it on his account.
(yet running from crontab as background process - not very fortunate).

On 'bonnet' account was running yet another process - CCUPI - java wrapper for UPI API.

Luke has in the afternoon arranged on the UPI server automatic submission of certificates.
Then we checked in LDAP of alv326 that very probably certificate was synchronized.
(Not really confirmed).

Cyrrile in the afternoon received his VPN token and finally can investigate
all circumstances.
However, wrapping the status up - we do not have system ready for testing or presentation and there is
integration/fixing work ahead of us.

Jan has asked about the staus of development of requirements and learned that
Use Cases UC7-UC10 from CTBTO-PKI CC_requirements-v0.11
have not been specified nor implemented - needs clarification about the status.
UC7 - User requests UPDATE_CRL (WIP)
UC8 - User notifies CRL_UPDATED (WIP)
UC9 - User generates report (WIP)
UC10 - User manages the list of notified recipients

---
Follow up - todo list:
Requirements -
It is needed to meet with the person reponsible for requirements and clarify missing use cases
- Jan to meet with Malakhova Marina and try to discuss it.

Architecture desing:
Would be good to think about crontab components, and how each process is started, stoped and monitored.
We need to have dedicated technical account on alv326 and the system deployed under technica account.
We need to prepare for rollout to APS by means of collecting documentaiton, installation procedures,
well documented configuration, testing and verification procedures.
Then we need additional machine to set up instance maintained and isntalled by APS (processing engineers) via a DCR.
(I have spoken with Alexander Sudakov - the system has to ready to be accepted by APS before doing this.)

Testing:
First we need test plan and established roles and test cases for involved people.
I have visited also Vlado Gelashvili - he will support us by creating valid CSR requests.
We need to test also error scenarios - test plan and first round of testing will be conducted by Cyrille.
We need to verify integration with PKI and UPI server next week when Luke is arround to support us.

# Integration test of Friday 31.1.2020
- first let us go through all workflow driven by Cyrille (add me to all recepients email addreses)
- record the statuses, components and logs of each component and per role

Fixed start_keypair_daemon
/apps/pkicc/logs/start_keypair_daemon.log
(looks for the latest cerificate)

Bug1. Bootstrapping does not work - need fix (when previous key-pairt started was not yet confirmed there is a nasty non handled error).
Bug2. I did not recieve email address as a notifier for the VIP00 station after boostrapping ? may be requriement
Bug3. Crontab for running start_keypair_daemon does not work, has to be investigated.
As agreed Cyrille please check it and work with Balazs if there is neede admin support.

Bug4. From email address is not provided (config issue).

apache log files - /apps/pkicc/LOG/apache.log.1 is older log file from 2019.
apache.log is the current one.
It does not log actions of cc_port very much - in info level it sould log each loop.
But it does log for example whole message including the certificate request:

---
And it did not log to which addresses actually each action has sent the emails, when it communicates with LDAP - only few debug messages.
Would be good in info level to log usefull information about the successful action from cc_portal.
Important are e.g. unique identifiers - transaction id, station ids etc. for quick troubleshooting.

Improvement 1:Missing logout button which would loggout from the portal and SSO.

Another test loop with the same CSR.
Bug 5. It was successful up to Keypair statered use case which was blocked by the non running 'start_keypair_daemon'.
ldapsearch has confirmed that the certificate was actually requested in the UPI server.
Should be investigated whether this is desired behaviour.

# 16.9.2020 - hand over testing of PKI C&C portal with different stations
I have tried to retrieve the certificates from the
pkildap16.test.ctbto.org
with Edward's script or dirrectly with ldap search but it did not work for me.
Also I did not manage to generate certificate with known valid date using openssl.
Latter found option to use '-days' argument to override default validity.

However here is procedure for DSA key:
> openssl dsaparam -genkey 2048 | openssl dsa -out ws01-vip00-DSA.key
> chmod 700 privatekey
> openssl req -key ws01-vip00-DSA.key -new -days 365 -subj '/O=CTBTO/OU=IMS/OU=Data Authenticators/L=VIP00/CN=WS01-VIP00' -out ws01-vip00-ws01-dsa.csr
-- This is valid DSA CSR for the portal and UPI server.

If we want to generate ECDSA key there is the following procedure:
> openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ws01-vip00-ECDSA.key
> openssl req -new -sha256 -key ws01-vip00-ECDSA.key -subj '/O=CTBTO, OU=IMS, OU=Data Authenticators, L=VIP00, CN=WS01-VIP00' -out ws01-vip00-ecdsa.csr
-- this is valid ECDSA CSR for the portal and UPI server.
-- observe the difference in dname format for these two types of CSRs.

But automatic approval works only for ws01-vip00, not for other stations:
I will generate - 1. correct DSA CSRs and 2. malformed DSA CSRs for the following stations:
   TORD
   VIP00
   KWP40
   I18DK
   DEX33
   H05N
   MBAR

This command has found for me several certificates:
ldapsearch -x -h pkildap16.test.ctbto.org -b "cn=ws01-vip00,l=VIP00,ou=Data Authenticators,ou=IMS,o=ctbto" objectclass=* | less
However, this is still not the one with latest validity.
All looks like the automatic generation of the certificate for ws01-vip00 always just returns the same cerificate.
For full test we need to include Salim and test different stations yet.

And it is really the one with latest start date - from 3. September 2020.

Edwards script does not take one neither the last one nor the newest one.
Just one from Feb 6 14:49:31.
It is not even one from top or bottom how they are ordered in LDAP.

So it looks so far, LDAP search on PKI C&C works well, and malfunctional is Edward's script.
But it can be fixed yet - may be.

# Meesasges from PKI Portal from Marina.

The authentication@ctbto.org was not mailbox it was distribution list, which probably is not working anymore.

@Michaela, Would it be possible to check where/to whom/how emails for authentication@ctbto.org are landed?

== she could not receive emails from this address
Which SMTP server(s) was used for sending in both (success/failure) cases?
