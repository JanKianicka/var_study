MPI - message parsing interface (commands are sent via network - we
have 1000dns of CPUs)
Second option available is using GPU threads.

Most of the software available directly in Devana is for
quantum-chemical computations.

SLURM - (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) scheduler for
dostributed computations on a super-computer
https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html

Singularity - container platform which e.g. overcomes security issues
of Docker.
https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html

Practical commands of SLURM:
    sinfo
    squeue
    srun
    sbatch
Details in downloaded documentation.

Enviroment:
Very usefull and simple to use are "modules":
    module av - lists all available installed modules
    module load <name> - loads whole module including env change (PATH)
    module spider <name> - gives very detail info about the module

Docker:
    We use Singularity:
    module load singularity
    singularity pull docker://<name> - will donwload and install public Docker image.

Like this one can download and install whole PyTorch including CUDA.
It is recommended to install packages published by NVIDIA because
Devana is using NVIDIA GPUs.

There is also HelpDesk in HPC with support.
