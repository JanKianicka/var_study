# Records about Sentinel 1 satellites

https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-1

The launch
Date: Sentinel-1A - 03 April 2014 
      Sentinel-1B - 25 April 2016 
      Sentinel-1C - 2024

The Sentinel-1 mission is designed as a constellation of two
satellites orbiting 180° apart, which can image the entire Earth every
six days.
The mission ended for Sentinel-1B in 2022.

Orbit: Polar, Sun-synchronous at an altitude of 693 km.
Satellite: 2.8 m long, 2.5 m wide, 4 m high with 2×10 m-long solar
arrays and a 12 m-long radar antenna
Mass: 2300 kg (including 130 kg fuel)
Instrument: C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) at 5.405 GHz
            (waveleght 5.6 cm)

Operational modes:
 - IW - Interferometric wide-swath mode at 250 km and 5×20 m resolution
 - WV - Wave-mode images of 20×20 km and 5×5 m resolution (at 100 km intervals)
 - SM - Strip map mode at 80 km swath and 5×5 m resolution
 - EW - Extra wide-swath mode of 400 km and 20×40 m resolution

Prime contractors: Thales Alenia Space, Italy for the satellite;
Airbus Defence and Space, Germany for the SAR instrument

Instrument:
- Sentinel-1 carries a 12 m-long advanced synthetic aperture radar (SAR), working in C-band
- Modes:

  - Interferometric Wide swath mode .. Terrain Observation with
    Progressive Scans SAR – or TOPSAR  
  - Wave mode acquisitions - determine the direction, wavelength and
    heights of waves on the open oceans (three different incidence
    angles)
  - Stripmap - continuity of ERS (80 km width)
  - Extra Wide Swath - intended for maritime, ice and polar zone
    operational services where wide coverage and short revisit times
    are demanded (TOPSAR technique using five sub-swaths instead of
    three)

About the launch:
- launched on Russian Soyuz rocket, which performed more than 1700 missions

Data Flow:
- The Sentinel-1 Flight Operations Control Centre is located at ESA's
  ESOC establishment in Darmstadt, Germany, with telemetry and
  commands managed via the ground station in Kiruna, Sweden.
- data disseminated in X band, and over laser to geostationary
  satellites and then by Ka-band
- While the ground segment of each Sentinel mission includes specific
  components, all the related facilities are united to form the
  Copernicus Space Component Ground Segment.  In particular, access to
  the Copernicus Space Component (CSC) data is coordinated through the
  CSC Data Access System.

Data products:
- Four modes are yet combined with polarisation modes:
  single polarisation (VV or HH) for WV.
  For other modes dual polarisation scheme is available (VV+VH or
  HH+HV) as well as single polarisation (HH or VV).
  - Level-0: Compressed and unfocused raw data
  - Level-1 Single Look Complex: Focused data, geo-referenced using
    orbit and attitude data from the satellite, and provided in
    slant-range geometry. These products have a typical size of 8GB
    (in IW mode dual-polarisation) and 4 GB (in IW mode single
    polarisation).
  - Level-1 Ground Range Detected: focused data that has been
    detected, multi-looked and projected to ground range using an
    Earth ellipsoid model. Typical product size is 1GB (in IW mode).
  - Level-2: Systematically distributed ocean products for wind, wave
    and currents applications.

Installed SNAP and there
File -> ProductLibrary to search and download Sentinel-1 data.

After registration also connection and downloading the data through
SNAP works. But only after upgrade of pluggins.  Now the first
processing step after importing the data fails with Null pointer
exception.

Experiment with Presov-Solivar with SNAP - multibaseline interferograms
----------------------------------------------------------------------
September 2024

The scenes were chosen based on climatological data
- freezing winter days only.

We will try to generated interferograms
1. Adjacent
2. Every second - appr. one year temp. baseline.

    1. 1.2.2015-28.11.2015 - S1A, Tp ~20m, Tt 300d - lost of coherence on Solivar hill
    2. 26.11.2015-3.1.2016 - S1A, Tp ~100m, Tt 36d - also lost coherence on Solivar hill,
                             but detected different freezing of agricultural fields.
    3. 9.1.2017-11.1.2019 - S1A, Tp ~27m, Tt 760d - lost of coherence on Solivar hill,
                             in the city of Presov not big difference to the
			     one year time lap.
    4. S1A 5.1.2019-S1B 11.1.2019 - Tp

Verification of SARPROZ Linux compiled installation
---------------------------------------------------
September 2024
Successfully processed Turkey earthquaqe but with strange errors in the log file.
Probably related to Matlab Runtime environment.

Copernicus Contribution Mission data are also available on OData API - ALOS is just marginal
but there is e.g. PAZ, TerraSAR-X or Radarsat

Euro Data Cube Public Collection publishes derived data, e.g DEM also from ALOS data:
https://collections.eurodatacube.com/

Earth Online ESA system simillar like Copernicus CDSE APIs offers old
ALOS products, we should at least register and try to download some.
