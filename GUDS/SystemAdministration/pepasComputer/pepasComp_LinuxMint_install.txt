# Installation and configuration of Linux Mint Cinammon 22.1 LTS 64bit
# on Juraj Miskolczi computer.
# Jan Kianicka - march 2025

1. Downloading latest LTS ISO file and burning as Bootable disk on USB
   stick 8GB with empty file system. linuxmint-22.1-cinnamon-64bit.iso
   On my Linux Mint a special system utility was used for this purpose
   (USB Bootable Image Creation).
   
2. Windows on the computer was protected against booting from USB
   port.  The system disk had to be unmounted, BIOS was reset and the
   SATA C: disk was formatted externaly.
   
3. In spite of that, the original order of booting could not be
   changed due to password protection of the BIOS - not even removing
   of battery, and thus resetting the BIOS did not help.
   
4. By sticking USB stick with the Linux Mint installation and pressing
   F12 one could invoke loading agent and choose the USB stick for
   booting.

5. The operating system was installed following the standard
   procedure on fast SSD disk /dev/sdb1. Partitioning did not work at first time.
   I had to manually create elf vfat partition.
   On main 2TB disk /dev/sda1 was earesed and formatted to ext4.
   Mounted to /mnt/D under start/up user priviledges.

6. Two super-users were created:
       ppaudits
       kianicka
   Initial passwords shall be provided.

7. Input methods were installed:
       USA English(Default)
       SK (QWERTY) second
       
8. Static network according previous Windows installation was configured:
   IP: 192.168.0.125
   Mask: 255.255.224.0
   GW: 192.168.4.1
   DNS: 192.168.0.1

9. SSH server installed and configured:
       apt install openssh-client
       apt install openssh-server
       systemctl restart ssh.service
       systemctl status ssh.service
       sshd -t -f /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       systemctl enable ssh.service
