# Installation and configuration of LinuxFX

1. Downloading latest LTS ISO file and burning as Bootable disk on USB
   stick 8GB with empty file system.  linuxfx-11.25.02-noble-lts.iso
   On my Linux Mint a special system utility was used for this purpose
   (USB Bootable Image Creation).
   
2. Windows on the computer was protected against booting from USB
   port.  The system disk had to be unmounted, BIOS was reset and the
   SATA C: disk was formatted externally.
   
3. In spite of that, the original order of booting could not be
   changed due to password protection of the BIOS - not even removing
   of battery, and thus resetting the BIOS did not help.
   
4. By sticking USB stick with the LinuxFX installation and pressing
   F12 one could invoke loading agent and choose the USB stick for
   booting.

5. The operating system was installed following the standard
   procedure.  On main 2TB disk /dev/sda1 formatted to ext4 was
   installed system.  Another Hard Drive /dev/sdb1 was also formatted
   to ext4 and mounted to /mnt/D.

6. Two super-users were created:
       ppaudits
       kianicka
   Initial passwords shall be provided.

7. Input methods were installed:
       USA English(Default)
       SK (QWERTY) second
       
8. Static network according previous Windows installation was configured:
   IP: 192.168.0.125
   Mask: 255.255.224.0
   GW: 192.168.4.1
   DNS: 192.168.0.1

9. Configuration of Windows Remote Desktop server to connect from
   different computers
   Following this entry:
   https://askubuntu.com/questions/592537/can-i-access-ubuntu-from-windows-remotely
   As user:
       echo xfce4-session > ~/.xsession
   As root:
       apt-get install xrdp
       apt-get install xfce4
       vim /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
       -- and replace content with
       #!/bin/sh

       if [ -r /etc/default/locale ]; then
            . /etc/default/locale
            export LANG LANGUAGE
       fi

       startxfce4
       --
       service xrdp restart
       service xrdp status
       
       And verify by connecting from Windows machine using IP address
       and rdc protocol.
       Successfully verified from my computer.

10. Installation of packages using command line as root:
       apt update
       apt install mc
       apt install vim
       apt install firefox
       apt install emacs
       apt install gimp


11. QGIS
    The procedure described in:
    https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/393282/installing-qgis-ltr-instead-of-latest-version-on-ubuntu
    or in QGIS page for Debian/Ubuntu does not work.
    When downloading the QGIS installation, msi Windows file was downloaded by default.
    This required another dependency:
       Wine software
    Downloaded and installed - locally.

    Keys:
    wget https://download.qgis.org/downloads/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg
    gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring ./qgis-archive-keyring.gpg --export --output /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg
    

The default version installed using apt
was 3.40 Bratislava.
After playing arround and cleaning out the mass,
the following procedure has worked:

    add-apt-repository --remove "deb https://qgis.org/ubuntu $(lsb_release -c -s) main"
    cleaned /etc/apt/sources.list
    add-apt-repository "https://qgis.org/ubuntu-ltr"
    apt update
    apt-cache policy qgis
    apt install qgis=1:3.34.15+40noble

Removal of lattest unstable version
    apt remove qgis
    apt autoremove
    apt purge qgis
    
TODO: to be cleaned and created special file for description of troubles.
