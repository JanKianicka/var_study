Turn off:
Hypervisor protected Code Integrity (HVCI), also known as Memory Integrity (see fth0's post below)
DeviceGuard (See InfoSecDr's post below)
Memory Integrity (See fth0's post below)
Secure Core (See Mpack's post below)
CredentialGuard
Windows Defender's Core Isolation
Memory Protection (see Stickybit's and UliBÃ¤r's posts below

cmd as Admin:
    > bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
    > DISM /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V
    > shutdown -s -t 2

Let the computer rest a little.
Then it should work.

No it did not work.
Further:
Added registry entry:
Computer -> HKEY_local_machine -> system -> CurrentControlSet -> Control -> DeviceGuard
-> EnableVirtualizationBaseSecurity -> put to 0

And disabled memory integration in as:
To turn off the Windows Memory Integrity security feature, on the Windows host navigate to Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Device security > Core isolation > Memory integrity


Latter the machine was prepared on my Linux Workstation of version Ubuntu 20.04.6.
And was imported successfully.
Now we continue with Guest additions, ssh server and user for running SARPROZ.

> apt install gcc
> apt install openssh-server
> systemctl restart sshd.service
Created user for running sarproz
> useradd -m sarproz
> passwd sarproz (the same as user name)

> add shared folder - 
  Folder path E:\Jano\SARPROZ_PROC\InSAR\Sentinel1_test\Turkey_earthquake_2023\SLC
  Mount point /home/sarproz/Turkey_earthquake_2023/SLC
  Read-only, automount, permanent
  Yet, in order to access the files we need to add the user to the 'vboxsf
> sudo usermod -a -G vboxsf sarproz

Installing SARPROZ
As sarproz user:
> mkdir sarproz_trial_august2024
> copy the tar file there

From https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html download:
    MCR_R2017a_glnxa64_installer.zip
    MCR_R2017a_Update_3_glnxa64.sh
> mkdir MCR2017a
> mv MCR_R2017a_glnxa64_installer.zip MCR2017a
> unzip
> install (into /home/sarproz/sarproz_trial_august2024/MATLAB_Runtime)
> bash MCR_R2017a_Update_3_glnxa64.sh with path /home/sarproz/sarproz_trial_august2024/MATLAB_Runtime/v92

To run the SARPROZ software use this:
> chmod 777 run_main.sh; chmod 777 main;
> ./run_main.sh /home/sarproz/sarproz_trial_august2024/MATLAB_Runtime/v92
